Got it, Mariam! Let’s cut that part and rework it in a way that feels more true to your voice and views. Here's a revised version without that section—and with a smoother flow:

Pope Francis’ take on AI really stood out to me, especially how he ties it to personal, emotional moments that many of us can relate to. He’s reminding us that no matter how advanced technology becomes, it can’t capture the little things that shape who we are—like sealing the edge of a pie with a fork next to someone we love, or pressing a flower into a book as a quiet keepsake. Those moments carry feelings, connections, and memories that no algorithm could ever truly understand.

This perspective resonates with me because it highlights something I’ve been thinking about: AI can do a lot of impressive things, but it doesn’t experience life the way humans do. It doesn’t feel nostalgia, love, or wonder. And that emotional side of us—that creative, messy, deeply personal part—is what makes our experiences meaningful.

What Pope Francis says really adds another layer to the conversations we’ve been having this week. It brings the focus back to our humanity, and why it's so important to protect that in a world that's becoming more and more shaped by technology.

Let me know if you’d like to add something more personal to it—like a memory or example that means a lot to you—or if this version feels good as is!
