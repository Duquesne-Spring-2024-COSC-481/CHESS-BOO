# CHESS
This project introduces an AI-driven Chess Game that allows players to compete against an intelligent, adaptive opponent. Drawing inspiration from the exploration of AI's evolution in strategic games, as discussed in Stuart Russell's "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", this project leverages the complexity of chess as a testbed for advanced decision-making algorithms. The core of the AI opponent is built upon the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, enabling strategic move evaluation and providing an engaging gameplay experience.   

As a developer with a newfound fascination for chess's strategic depth, this project is motivated by the desire to explore how AI can simulate human-like decision-making in this complex game


# The project encompasses the following key components:

## Chess Logic Implementation: Ensuring valid piece movements, detecting check/checkmate conditions, and managing turn-based play.   

## AI Opponent: Implementing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize move selection and search efficiency.   

## User Interaction: Designing an intuitive user interface with click-and-drag movement, move validation, and optional hints for legal moves.   

## Adaptive Difficulty: Introducing rule-based adjustments or machine learning techniques to modify AI behavior based on player performance.   

## Optional Features: Including undo/redo functionality and performance tracking for players
