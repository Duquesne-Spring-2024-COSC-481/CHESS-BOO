## Overview of Chess Rules and Piece Movements
Chess is played on an 8x8 square grid known as a chessboard, with each of the two players controlling 16 pieces at the outset: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. 

While traditionally one set of pieces is white and the other black, you're welcome to choose any color scheme. 

The ultimate aim is to place the opponent's king under an inescapable threat of capture, known as checkmate. 

Here's a concise rundown of how each piece moves:

King: Can move one square in any direction.
Queen: Capable of moving any number of squares along a row, column, or diagonal.
Rook: Travels any number of squares along a row or column.
Bishop: Diagonally moves over any number of squares.
Knight: Leaps in an 'L' shape, covering two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or vice versa, able to jump over other pieces.
Pawn: Advances forward by one square (or two from its initial position), captures diagonally, and is subject to unique moves like 'en passant' and promotion.
